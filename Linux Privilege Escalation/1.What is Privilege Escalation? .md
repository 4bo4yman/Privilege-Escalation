Privilege escalation is a journey. There are no silver bullets, and much depends on the specific configuration of the target system. The kernel version, installed applications, supported programming languages, other users' passwords are a few key elements that will affect your road to the root shell.

### What does "privilege escalation" mean?

At it's core, Privilege Escalation usually involves going from a lower permission account to a higher permission one. More technically, it's the exploitation of a vulnerability, design flaw, or configuration oversight in an operating system or application to gain unauthorized access to resources that are usually restricted from the users.

### Why is it important?

It's rare when performing a real-world penetration test to be able to gain a foothold (initial access) that gives you direct administrative access. Privilege escalation is crucial because it lets you gain system administrator levels of access, which allows you to perform actions such as:

  * Resetting passwords
  * Bypassing access controls to compromise protected data
  * Editing software configurations
  * Enabling persistence
  * Changing the privilege of existing (or new) users
  * Execute any administrative command
