Enumeration is the first step you have to take once you gain access to any system. You may have accessed the system by exploiting a critical vulnerability that resulted in root-level access or just found a way to send commands using a low privileged account. Penetration testing engagements, unlike CTF machines, don't end once you gain access to a specific system or user privilege level. As you will see, enumeration is as important during the post-compromise phase as it is before.

**************


<h3 align="center">hostname</h3>

The ```hostname``` command will return the hostname of the target machine. Although this value can easily be changed or have a relatively meaningless string (e.g. Ubuntu-3487340239), in some cases, it can provide information about the target system’s role within the corporate network (e.g. SQL-PROD-01 for a production SQL server).

**********

<h3 align="center">uname -a</h3>

Will print system information giving us additional detail about the kernel used by the system. This will be useful when searching for any potential kernel vulnerabilities that could lead to privilege escalation.

*********

<h3 align="center">Version of System</h3>

Type ```lsb_release -a``` to check the ubuntu version.

ex:
```
lsb_release -a
```

</p> 

*******

<h3 align="center">/proc/version</h3>

The proc filesystem (procfs) provides information about the target system processes. You will find proc on many different Linux flavours, making it an essential tool to have in your arsenal.

Looking at ```/proc/version``` may give you information on the kernel version and additional data such as whether a compiler (e.g. GCC) is installed.

*******

<h3 align="center">/etc/issue</h3>

Systems can also be identified by looking at the ```/etc/issue``` file. This file usually contains some information about the operating system but can easily be customized or changed. While on the subject, any file containing system information can be customized or changed. For a clearer understanding of the system, it is always good to look at all of these.

******

<h3 align="center">ps Command</h3>

The ```ps``` command is an effective way to see the running processes on a Linux system. Typing ```ps``` on your terminal will show processes for the current shell.

The output of the ```ps``` (Process Status) will show the following;

  * PID: The process ID (unique to the process)
  * TTY: Terminal type used by the user
  * Time: Amount of CPU time used by the process (this is NOT the time this process has been running for)
  * CMD: The command or executable running (will NOT display any command line parameter)

The “ps” command provides a few useful options.

 * ```ps -A``` : View all running processes
 * ```ps axjf``` : View process tree (see the tree formation until ps axjf is run below)
 * ```ps aux``` : The aux option will show processes for all users (a), display the user that launched the process (u), and show processes that are not attached to a terminal (x). Looking at the ps aux command output, we can have a better understanding of the system and potential vulnerabilities.

********

<h3 align="center">env</h3>

The ```env``` command will show environmental variables.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/4bo4yman/Privilege-Escalation/assets/156849852/e6ad7516-0c30-4598-9265-dc1a33cd1c71" height="600px">
</p>

The PATH variable may have a compiler or a scripting language (e.g. Python) that could be used to run code on the target system or leveraged for privilege escalation.

**********

<h3 align="center">sudo -l</h3>

The target system may be configured to allow users to run some (or all) commands with root privileges. The ```sudo -l``` command can be used to list all commands your user can run using ```sudo``` .

***********

<h3 align="center">ls</h3>

One of the common commands used in Linux is probably ```ls``` .


While looking for potential privilege escalation vectors, please remember to always use the ```ls``` command with the ```-la``` parameter. The example below shows how the “secret.txt” file can easily be missed using the ```ls``` or ```ls -l``` commands.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/4bo4yman/Privilege-Escalation/assets/156849852/9122435d-801b-4c76-b49a-2c1d3bac8676" >
</p>

********

 <h3 align="center">Id</h3>

The ```id``` command will provide a general overview of the user’s privilege level and group memberships.


It is worth remembering that the ```id``` command can also be used to obtain the same information for another user as seen below.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/4bo4yman/Privilege-Escalation/assets/156849852/96d1ef90-b14a-4c0e-81dd-048c23f67e60" >
</p>

******

<h3 align="center">/etc/passwd</h3>

Reading the ```/etc/passwd``` file can be an easy way to discover users on the system.


<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/4bo4yman/Privilege-Escalation/assets/156849852/6e7a0502-b599-4830-a9a3-c114ee0d985e" >
</p>

 While the output can be long and a bit intimidating, it can easily be cut and converted to a useful list for brute-force attacks. 

<p align="center">

</p>

Remember that this will return all users, some of which are system or service users that would not be very useful. Another approach could be to grep for “home” as real users will most likely have their folders under the “home” directory.

<p align="center">

</p>

*******

<h3 align="center">getent passwd + "user's Shell"</userOfSystem></h3>

The user’s shell is defined in the /etc/passwd file.

getent is a common way to look up in user details on Linux. Since getent uses the same name of service as the system, getent will be going to show all information, including that gained from the network information sources such as LDAP. The databases it usually searches in are: ahosts, ahostsv4, ahostsv6, aliases, ethers (Ethernet addresses), group, gshadow, hosts, netgroup, networks, passwd, protocols, rpc, services, and shadow.

type getent passwd www-data and press submit to obtain the user’s shell. The 7th field of an entry in etc/passwd file is the home directory of the user (user’s shell).


ex:

```
getent passwd www-data
```

******
<h3 align="center">history</h3>

Looking at earlier commands with the ```history``` command can give us some idea about the target system and, albeit rarely, have stored information such as passwords or usernames.

*******

<h3 align="center">ifconfig</h3>

The target system may be a pivoting point to another network. The ```ifconfig``` command will give us information about the network interfaces of the system. The example below shows the target system has three interfaces (eth0, tun0, and tun1). Our attacking machine can reach the eth0 interface but can not directly access the two other networks. 

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/4bo4yman/Privilege-Escalation/assets/156849852/49a47052-fe81-4a00-80a1-302add38daf3" height="600px">
</p>

 This can be confirmed using the ```ip route``` command to see which network routes exist. 

<p align="center">

</p>

********

 <h3 align="center">netstat</h3>


Following an initial check for existing interfaces and network routes, it is worth looking into existing communications. The netstat command can be used with several different options to gather information on existing connections.


   * ```netstat -a``` : shows all listening ports and established connections.
   * ```netstat -at``` or ```netstat -au``` can also be used to list TCP or UDP protocols respectively.
   * ```netstat -l``` : list ports in “listening” mode. These ports are open and ready to accept incoming connections. This can be used with the “t” option to list only ports that are listening using the TCP protocol (below)

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/4bo4yman/Privilege-Escalation/assets/156849852/51793c30-2198-4300-ac67-fd9b38dc75d3" >
</p>

   * ```netstat -s``` : list network usage statistics by protocol (below) This can also be used with the -t or -u options to limit the output to a specific protocol. 

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/4bo4yman/Privilege-Escalation/assets/156849852/900240f8-5538-425b-b209-5810e04b30b8" >
</p>

  * ```netstat -tp``` : list connections with the service name and PID information.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/4bo4yman/Privilege-Escalation/assets/156849852/4b737c1d-eecc-45de-84d4-1d7f62eae302" >
</p>

 This can also be used with the ```-l``` option to list listening ports (below)

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/4bo4yman/Privilege-Escalation/assets/156849852/221ee920-1ce0-41aa-8b5a-901a55161ec3" >
</p>

We can see the “PID/Program name” column is empty as this process is owned by another user.

Below is the same command run with root privileges and reveals this information as 2641/nc (netcat)

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/4bo4yman/Privilege-Escalation/assets/156849852/f4f2c60e-2e22-4420-90e9-f4e8acfdc342" >
</p>


  * ```netstat -i``` : Shows interface statistics. We see below that “eth0” and “tun0” are more active than “tun1”.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/4bo4yman/Privilege-Escalation/assets/156849852/5f74dc24-ad68-4356-bfb1-e0d4af5a1821" >
</p>

 The ```netstat``` usage you will probably see most often in blog posts, write-ups, and courses is ```netstat -ano``` which could be broken down as follows;

   * ```-a``` : Display all sockets
   * ```-n``` : Do not resolve names
   * ```-o``` : Display timers


<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/4bo4yman/Privilege-Escalation/assets/156849852/e92ececc-9329-4af0-8640-3da46621b21a" >
</p>

******

<h3 align="center">find Command</h3>


Searching the target system for important information and potential privilege escalation vectors can be fruitful. The built-in “find” command is useful and worth keeping in your arsenal.

Below are some useful examples for the “find” command.

Find files:

   * ``` find . -name flag1.txt ``` : find the file named “flag1.txt” in the current directory
   * ``` find /home -name flag1.txt ``` : find the file names “flag1.txt” in the /home directory
   * ``` find / -type d -name config ``` : find the directory named config under “/”
   * ``` find / -type f -perm 0777 ``` : find files with the 777 permissions (files readable, writable, and executable by all users)
   * ``` find / -perm a=x ``` : find executable files
   * ``` find /home -user frank ``` : find all files for user “frank” under “/home”
   * ``` find / -mtime 10 ``` : find files that were modified in the last 10 days
   * ``` find / -atime 10 ``` : find files that were accessed in the last 10 day
   * ``` find / -cmin -60 ``` : find files changed within the last hour (60 minutes)
   * ``` find / -amin -60 ``` : find files accesses within the last hour (60 minutes)
   * ``` find / -size 50M ``` : find files with a 50 MB size

This command can also be used with (+) and (-) signs to specify a file that is larger or smaller than the given size. 


<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/4bo4yman/Privilege-Escalation/assets/156849852/074a0329-748b-417a-8a8e-191bdf0e6ada" >
</p>

The example above returns files that are larger than 100 MB. It is important to note that the “find” command tends to generate errors which sometimes makes the output hard to read. This is why it would be wise to use the “find” command with “-type f 2>/dev/null” to redirect errors to “/dev/null” and have a cleaner output (below).

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/4bo4yman/Privilege-Escalation/assets/156849852/a7a82cba-1dfc-4298-bae2-af016f0e009b" >
</p>

Folders and files that can be written to or executed from:

   * ``` find / -writable -type d 2>/dev/null ``` : Find world-writeable folders
   * ``` find / -perm -222 -type d 2>/dev/null ``` : Find world-writeable folders
   * ``` find / -perm -o w -type d 2>/dev/null ``` : Find world-writeable folders
   * ``` find / -perm -o x -type d 2>/dev/null ``` : Find world-executable folders

Find development tools and supported languages:

   * ``` find / -name perl* ```
   * ``` find / -name python* ```
   * ``` find / -name gcc* ```

Find specific file permissions:

Below is a short example used to find files that have the SUID bit set. The SUID bit allows the file to run with the privilege level of the account that owns it, rather than the account which runs it. This allows for an interesting privilege escalation path. The example below is given to complete the subject on the “find” command.

   * ``` find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null ``` : Find files with the SUID bit, which allows us to run the file with a higher privilege level than the current user. 

General Linux Commands

As we are in the Linux realm, familiarity with Linux commands, in general, will be very useful. Please spend some time getting comfortable with commands such as ```find``` , ```locate``` , ```grep``` , ```cut``` , ```sort``` , ```etc``` .

### hidden files in webpages
1. /robots.txt         " robots.txt for a ‘disallow’ value to stop search engines from indexing."

2. /.htaccess          " file contain some information"

3. /.DS_Store        " .DS_Store, which stands for Desktop Services Store is a hidden file created in every local folder in Mac OS X."
